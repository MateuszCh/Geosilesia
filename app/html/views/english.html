        <h2>About project</h2>
        <p>The GeoSilesia is „The educational and informational website about geological and geomorphological heritage in the Silesian Voivodeship (Southern Poland)”.</p>
        <p>The main goal of the website is to promote and disseminate information about Silesian inanimate nature objects, both immovable (in situ – natural and artificial outcrops, crags, caves and others) and movable (ex situ – specimens in museums: minerals, rocks, fossils and stones in buildings and equipment elements), as well as mining, metallurgical and hydrotechnical objects associated to the exploitation of various resources. All listed objects are our natural and cultural heritage what is connected with the protection of geo-diversity and the tourism development.</p>
        <p>Especially valuable geological, geomorphological and industrial objects, which are relevant for understanding the history of the Earth, are called geosites. The information on geosites in Poland, located all over the country, is provided by the <a href="http://geoportal.pgi.gov.pl/portal/page/portal/geostanowiska/">Central Register of Polish Geosites (CRGP)</a>.</p>
        <p>Some geosites are, or may become after appropriate promotion and popularisation, an object of tourist interest, in other words,  a geotouristic object. Geotouristic objects and phenomena  have created the single category of geotouristic attractions. The connection of  geotouristic attractions by specially organized and marked didactic paths allows to make visitors interested in the geological structure of the region.</p>
        <p>Existing and potential geotouristic attractions of the Silesian Voivodeship are presented in the GeoSilesia on the interactive map (check homepage) in the following categories:</p>
